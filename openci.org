** TODO Test Levels
Provide facility for a job to pass the "level" of testing required, eg. minimal, full, etc., where different tests are executed depending on the level passed into (TF-M ID10, TF-A ID31)




* M5	Specify FVP Versions (TF-A ID13) [0/3]
** TODO Update FVP support to host multiple versions of models :non_arm_ci_job:
** TODO Allow jobs to specify which version of FVP models are used :arm_ci_job:

** TODO Compilers accessed via volumes mounted in the docker containers :non_arm_ci_job:
- Ability to integrate alternative compilers into builds (TF-M ID9, TF-A ID10)
- Ability to use different versions of a compiler for builds (TF-A ID11)
- Integrate one alternative compiler and have two versions of the standard Arm GCC compiler to demonstrate how the functionality works. Compilers should be secure, preventing users from accessing them directly, and should only be used for building TF CI jobs

* How to submit LSS tickets to Linaro

    Go to https://projects.linaro.org/secure/CreateIssue!default.jspa

    Fill in the drop down boxes:
        Project: LAB & System Software (LSS)
        Issue Type: Ticket
        Click Next

    Fill in the required details
        Summary: You should fill in the "Summary" with a snappy title. I've started to prefix my titles with "TF CI: " to help identify them in the list of issues.
        Components: "Systems (Bugzilla, Git, Gerrit, Jenkins)"
        Client Stakeholder: "Trusted-Firmware"

    Fill in the issue Description
        You will need to fill in the Description, even if you think the title is sufficient. Provide enough overview detail so the issue is clear to understand by management, but make sure you include all the technical details you need for the support engineer to reproduce and resolve your problem.

    Click the "Create" button at the bottom of the page

    Add Watchers
        It's probably a good idea to add Bill Fletcher and Ryan Harkin to the Watchers on the ticket.

If you are unable to create a ticket or have issues, you may need Jira access setup. Please contact: Glen (glen.valante@linaro.org) or Bill (bill.fletcher@linaro.org) or Ryan (ryan.harkin@linaro.org)
